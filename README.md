# ML2021-Chatbot-Project
Creation of Basic ChatBot which runs on the Terminal
# How it works-An insight 
Hello there! nice to see you checking our project... this is about a simple chat bot. we tell this bot which car do we require in a small automotive showroom.
Firstly when you enter the interface the bot intoduces itself and asks about the details about the car you want among four indian based Companies.
if you select any one of the company(between numbers 1 and 4) it will give you an detailed view of models in a particular brand. Then you have to choose which type you want do buy(now you have to select between 5 and 7).
then you are directed to the details of the car such as its Model name,Price,colour and finally its year of release.
Happily you can choose the car you want.
Thank you..
